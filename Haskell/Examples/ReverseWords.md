### Problem Statement

Define a function where, when given a sentence it will reverse each word in the
sentence but keep the original order of the words. For example, take the
sentence "Learn You a Haskell for Great Good", it would become "nraeL uoY a
lleksaH rof taerG dooG".

You will be given a number of sentences line by line, run this reverse function
over all.

This question originally came from a Google Code Jam question, modified by my
hazy memory of the question.

### Input Format

You will be given **N** sentences, separated by newline characters.

### Constraints

0 ≤ **N** ≤ 100

### Output Format

**N** lines containing the reverse string separated new line characters.

### Sample Input

```
Learn You a Haskell for Great Good
```

### Sample Output
```
nraeL uoY a lleksaH rof taerG dooG
```
